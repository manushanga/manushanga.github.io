I am currently working on static code analysis tooling at Oracle. I earned my Ph.D. for the work titled 
'Towards Automatic Power Analysis Leakage Elimination' from the University of Adelaide. 
Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer in LSEG Technology implementing Suspend-to-Disk for FinTech programs.
